            "content":"The Mars InSight lander has detected seismic and acoustic waves created when four space rocks impacted the surface of the Red Planet. InSight's seismometer felt the vibrations from the impacts in 2020 and 2021, marking the first detections of meteoroids hitting the planet since the lander began gathering data after touching down in 2018. The meteoroid impacts occurred between 53 miles (85 kilometers) and 180 miles (290 km) from InSight's location in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars, a broad plain that stretches across the Martian equator."
